			Here are the points that you need to look for when you are searching for your next "investment" opportunity.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The coin must <strong>not</strong> have a Bounty on  <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0"> Bitcointalk.org </a> </li>
			<li>The coin must have an active github, check it from <a href="https://www.coinmarketcap.com"> coinmarketcap.com  </a> </li>
			<li>The coin must have a half working Alpha / Beta Release.</li>
			<li>Go on reddit and check the subreddit of the specific coin. Check the users that are posting and their history. Use my 
				<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-user-explorer/gophgjgjlollkjofchhmjhekpmdiaeob">chrome extension</a>
				to check their posts/comments distribution. It should not be one-sided. There are people who make money promoting scam coins, 
				you can do too, if that is how you roll.</li>
			<li>Check the Telegram Group of the coin, if it is a boring channel that all they are talking about is promotions and post latest articles, get out</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The are professionals out there who specialize on "Blockchain Marketing", namely they promote a vision, they produce a Whitepaper, they have a website
			they are on all social Media. And they do their work good, they can convience you 100 % and make you invest.
			</p>
			<p>
			Yes Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard, that does not mean that if you drop out of your city's local collegue you will succeed like him.
			If you find a coin that breaks even one of the above rules, you should be wise to stay away. If not , please feel free to send me the name, 
			I will buy it from you, you name the price.
