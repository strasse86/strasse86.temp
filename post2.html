			<p> Well how many articles on January 2018 claimed that this is only the beginning once Ripple was hitting 4 dollars. And then the downfall started.
			We heard a lot of predictions about bitcoin for 2018 from 0$ to 100.000$ so the true has to lie somewhere there. But where exactly ?</p>
			
			<p> It feels that bitcoin at the moment ( June 2018 ) is not powerful enough and it has let a lot of "investors" down. But listen to the following thought:
			Bitcoin will be remembered after some years as the first tokenized Security. No, at the moment it is not classified as a security but eventually it will. 
			The goal was to make a digital currency but this will be achieved by some other mechanism, Lightning Network, another BTC fork -who knows and who cares.</p>
			
			<p> Securities will be represented by tokens. If the experiment is succesfull then money will follow. It is not a scary thought just a bit different of what 
			we are now thinking of. </p>
			
			<p> In closing I would like to think that bitcoin's price on December 31 2018 will be much lower than it was exactly one year before. Maybe also in 2019. But during this time 
			I will be accumulating as much as possible. Because when the rest of us realize that Bitcoin is the first of it's kind, it will be too late to buy it.
